## Introduction

This repository is the **complete map of my engineering journey** — everything I’m learning, building, and exploring, shared openly.  
It’s not just a list of links.  
It’s a *system*: a way to study, grow, and create things that matter.

I study **Computer Engineering**, but I’m not stopping at textbooks.  
My interests span:
- Robotics & Autonomous Systems
- Artificial Intelligence
- PCB & Hardware Design
- Systems Engineering
- Mathematics, Programming, and Problem Solving

From the fundamentals to advanced systems, this is where learning transforms into building, and building transforms into breakthroughs.

My mission with **amazing_eyes** is simple:
1. Share the best resources I’ve found  
2. Show how I apply them  
3. Inspire others to create their own path

## The Trinity Approach

Inspired by the *Deathly Hallows* from Harry Potter — three powerful artifacts that together grant mastery — **The Trinity Approach** is my framework for deep learning:

![deathly hallows](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f6ac353e-c04b-4743-a123-3b63bf3a4cf6)


**The Three Pillars:**
1. **Books** – Deep, timeless knowledge
2. **Courses / Tutorials / Papers** – Structured, guided learning
3. **Projects** – Real-world application

Individually, each pillar is powerful. Together, they create mastery.

# Systems and Hardware Repository

Welcome to the **Systems and Hardware** section of my GitHub repository, documenting my journey as a computer engineering student aiming to become a full-rounded engineer with a focus on robotics and autonomous vehicles. This category bridges **Operating Systems** and **Embedded Systems and Hardware Theory**, providing the low-level foundation for robotics applications like real-time control and sensor integration in competitions (e.g., F1TENTH, Shell Eco-marathon). Using the **trinity approach** (Books, Courses/Tutorials/Papers, Projects), this roadmap progresses from beginner to advanced levels, covering **software** (e.g., kernel programming, RTOS), **hardware** (e.g., microcontrollers, FPGA), and their integration for efficient, high-performance systems.

This README serves as the central hub for the Systems and Hardware category, outlining the roadmap, linking to resources, and showcasing projects. Whether you're a beginner, a fellow student, or a recruiter, use this repo to explore low-level systems, embedded hardware, and their applications in robotics and autonomous systems.

# Robotics and Autonomous Systems

Welcome to the **Robotics and Autonomous Systems** section of my GitHub repository, documenting my journey as a computer engineering student passionate about robotics and autonomous vehicles. This roadmap builds on my experience in competitions like F1TENTH and Shell Eco-marathon, where I’ve worked on energy-efficient planners and autonomous navigation. It covers the full spectrum from foundational concepts to cutting-edge applications, with a focus on the core stacks of **Perception**, **SLAM**, **Planning**, and **Controlling**, alongside critical areas like sensor fusion, modeling, and hardware selection. Using the **trinity approach** (Books, Courses/Tutorials/Papers, Projects), this roadmap progresses from beginner to expert levels, integrating **software** (ROS/ROS2, Python/C++), **simulators** (Gazebo, CARLA, Webots), and **hardware** (sensors, motors, microcontrollers).

This README serves as the central hub for the Robotics and Autonomous Systems category, outlining the roadmap, linking to resources, and showcasing projects. Whether you’re a beginner, a fellow student, or a recruiter, use this repo to explore robotics fundamentals, advanced autonomous systems, and practical applications in competitions.

- Curate high-quality **resources** (books, courses, tutorials, papers) to support learning across software, simulators, and hardware.
- Showcase **projects** that demonstrate practical skills, from simple Arduino bots to full autonomous vehicle systems in CARLA, tailored to my competition experience.
- Integrate with my broader repo, linking to `/Foundations` (e.g., control theory, programming) and `/Artificial_Intelligence` (e.g., RL for navigation).
- Highlight my journey, emphasizing autonomous vehicle competitions and contributions to open-source robotics (e.g., Autotronics Lab).

The roadmap is organized into four levels, covering **software** (ROS/ROS2, algorithms), **simulators** (Gazebo, CARLA, Webots), and **hardware** (sensors, motors, custom platforms). Each topic includes resources and projects stored in dedicated folders.

# PCB Design and Electronics

Welcome to the **PCB Design and Electronics** section of my GitHub repository, documenting my journey as a computer engineering student passionate about robotics and autonomous vehicles. This category focuses on designing, building, and testing printed circuit boards (PCBs) and electronics, critical for creating custom hardware for robotics projects like autonomous vehicle controllers in competitions (e.g., F1TENTH, Shell Eco-marathon). Using the **trinity approach** (Books, Courses/Tutorials/Papers, Projects), this roadmap progresses from beginner to advanced levels, covering **software** (e.g., KiCad, Eagle), **hardware** (e.g., components, soldering), and **testing** (e.g., oscilloscopes, multimeters). It integrates with my broader repo, linking to `/Foundations` (electronics basics) and `/Robotics_Autonomous_Systems` (hardware integration).

This README serves as the central hub for the PCB Design and Electronics category, outlining the roadmap, linking to resources, and showcasing projects. Whether you're a beginner, a fellow student, or a recruiter, use this repo to explore PCB design, electronics, and their applications in robotics.

## Projects
These projects leverage the provided resources to build practical skills, inspired by my competition experience. See `/Robotics_Autonomous_Systems/projects/` for code and documentation.

- **TurtleBot3 Navigation**: Use the [TurtleBot3](https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3) repo and [ROS Navigation](https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation) to implement a navigation stack in Gazebo. (Beginner, simulates F1TENTH navigation.)
- **RealSense Camera Integration**: Integrate an Intel RealSense camera with [RealSense ROS](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/realsense-ros) to process depth data for obstacle avoidance. (Intermediate, useful for Shell Eco-marathon sensor fusion.)
- **F1TENTH Autonomous Racing**: Build a ROS-based racing node using [Autonomous Racing](https://github.com/Autonomous-Racing-PG/ar-tu-do) and [GP-MPPI](https://github.com/IhabMohamed/GP-MPPI) for path planning. (Advanced, competition-ready.)
- **Costmap with Depth Camera**: Create a costmap for navigation using [Costmap Depth Camera](https://github.com/tsengapola/costmap_depth_camera) in a simulated environment. (Intermediate, enhances autonomous navigation.)
- **MoveIt Robotic Arm**: Implement a pick-and-place task with [MoveIt](https://github.com/moveit/moveit) for a robotic arm in simulation. (Advanced, explores manipulation.)
- **Jupyter Notebook on ROS2 Setup**: Document ROS2 Humble installation and basic node creation using [ROS Humble Tutorials](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials.html). (Beginner, educational.)
- **Markdown Guide on ROS Basics**: Summarize key ROS concepts (nodes, topics, services) based on [A Gentle Introduction to ROS](jokane.net/agitr/agitr-letter.pdf) (`/docs/ros_basics.md`). (Beginner, learning aid.)

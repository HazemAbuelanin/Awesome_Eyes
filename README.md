# 🚘 Awesome Autonomy & Computer Engineering Resources

Welcome to my personal knowledge base of **autonomous systems**, **robotics**, and **computer engineering** — built from real-world experience, research, and competitive projects like **F1TENTH**, **EVER Rally**, and more.

> 🎯 The goal: Help myself and others learn everything needed to **build, test, and deploy** intelligent robots and autonomous vehicles from the ground up.

## Introduction

This repository is the **complete map of my engineering journey** — everything I’m learning, building, and exploring, shared openly.  
It’s not just a list of links.  
It’s a *system*: a way to study, grow, and create things that matter.

I study **Computer Engineering**, but I’m not stopping at textbooks.  
My interests span:
- Robotics & Autonomous Systems
- Artificial Intelligence
- PCB & Hardware Design
- Systems Engineering
- Mathematics, Programming, and Problem Solving

And yes — I’ve competed in **autonomous vehicle competitions** and learned a lot about turning theory into real-world performance.

My mission with **amazing_eyes** is simple:
1. Share the best resources I’ve found  
2. Show how I apply them  
3. Inspire others to create their own path

## The Trinity Approach

Inspired by the *Deathly Hallows* from Harry Potter — three powerful artifacts that together grant mastery — **The Trinity Approach** is my framework for deep learning:

![deathly hallows](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f6ac353e-c04b-4743-a123-3b63bf3a4cf6)


**The Three Pillars:**
1. **Books** – Deep, timeless knowledge
2. **Courses / Tutorials / Papers** – Structured, guided learning
3. **Projects** – Real-world application

Individually, each pillar is powerful. Together, they create mastery.

## Roadmap Overview

Below is the **master roadmap** — each section contains:
- **Books** (theory)
- **Courses / Tutorials / Papers** (practice with guidance)
- **Projects** (independent application)

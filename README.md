## Introduction

This repository is the **complete map of my engineering journey** — everything I’m learning, building, and exploring, shared openly.  
It’s not just a list of links.  
It’s a *system*: a way to study, grow, and create things that matter.

I study **Computer Engineering**, but I’m not stopping at textbooks.  
My interests span:
- Robotics & Autonomous Systems
- Artificial Intelligence
- PCB & Hardware Design
- Systems Engineering
- Mathematics, Programming, and Problem Solving

From the fundamentals to advanced systems, this is where learning transforms into building, and building transforms into breakthroughs.

My mission with **amazing_eyes** is simple:
1. Share the best resources I’ve found  
2. Show how I apply them  
3. Inspire others to create their own path

## The Trinity Approach

Inspired by the *Deathly Hallows* from Harry Potter — three powerful artifacts that together grant mastery — **The Trinity Approach** is my framework for deep learning:

![deathly hallows](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f6ac353e-c04b-4743-a123-3b63bf3a4cf6)


**The Three Pillars:**
1. **Books** – Deep, timeless knowledge
2. **Courses / Tutorials / Papers** – Structured, guided learning
3. **Projects** – Real-world application

Individually, each pillar is powerful. Together, they create mastery.

# Systems and Hardware Repository

Welcome to the **Systems and Hardware** section of my GitHub repository, documenting my journey as a computer engineering student aiming to become a full-rounded engineer with a focus on robotics and autonomous vehicles. This category bridges **Operating Systems** and **Embedded Systems and Hardware Theory**, providing the low-level foundation for robotics applications like real-time control and sensor integration in competitions (e.g., F1TENTH, Shell Eco-marathon). Using the **trinity approach** (Books, Courses/Tutorials/Papers, Projects), this roadmap progresses from beginner to advanced levels, covering **software** (e.g., kernel programming, RTOS), **hardware** (e.g., microcontrollers, FPGA), and their integration for efficient, high-performance systems.

This README serves as the central hub for the Systems and Hardware category, outlining the roadmap, linking to resources, and showcasing projects. Whether you're a beginner, a fellow student, or a recruiter, use this repo to explore low-level systems, embedded hardware, and their applications in robotics and autonomous systems.

# Robotics and Autonomous Systems

Welcome to the **Robotics and Autonomous Systems** section of my GitHub repository, documenting my journey as a computer engineering student passionate about robotics and autonomous vehicles. This roadmap builds on my experience in competitions like F1TENTH and Shell Eco-marathon, where I’ve worked on energy-efficient planners and autonomous navigation. It covers the full spectrum from foundational concepts to cutting-edge applications, with a focus on the core stacks of **Perception**, **SLAM**, **Planning**, and **Controlling**, alongside critical areas like sensor fusion, modeling, and hardware selection. Using the **trinity approach** (Books, Courses/Tutorials/Papers, Projects), this roadmap progresses from beginner to expert levels, integrating **software** (ROS/ROS2, Python/C++), **simulators** (Gazebo, CARLA, Webots), and **hardware** (sensors, motors, microcontrollers).

This README serves as the central hub for the Robotics and Autonomous Systems category, outlining the roadmap, linking to resources, and showcasing projects. Whether you’re a beginner, a fellow student, or a recruiter, use this repo to explore robotics fundamentals, advanced autonomous systems, and practical applications in competitions.

- Curate high-quality **resources** (books, courses, tutorials, papers) to support learning across software, simulators, and hardware.
- Showcase **projects** that demonstrate practical skills, from simple Arduino bots to full autonomous vehicle systems in CARLA, tailored to my competition experience.
- Integrate with my broader repo, linking to `/Foundations` (e.g., control theory, programming) and `/Artificial_Intelligence` (e.g., RL for navigation).
- Highlight my journey, emphasizing autonomous vehicle competitions and contributions to open-source robotics (e.g., Autotronics Lab).

The roadmap is organized into four levels, covering **software** (ROS/ROS2, algorithms), **simulators** (Gazebo, CARLA, Webots), and **hardware** (sensors, motors, custom platforms). Each topic includes resources and projects stored in dedicated folders.

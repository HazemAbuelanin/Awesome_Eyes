## Introduction

This repository is the **complete map of my engineering journey** â€” everything Iâ€™m learning, building, and exploring, shared openly.  
Itâ€™s not just a list of links.  
Itâ€™s a *system*: a way to study, grow, and create things that matter.

I study **Computer Engineering**, but Iâ€™m not stopping at textbooks.  
My interests span:
- Robotics & Autonomous Systems
- Artificial Intelligence
- PCB & Hardware Design
- Systems Engineering
- Mathematics, Programming, and Problem Solving

From the fundamentals to advanced systems, this is where learning transforms into building, and building transforms into breakthroughs.

My mission with **amazing_eyes** is simple:
1. Share the best resources Iâ€™ve found  
2. Show how I apply them  
3. Inspire others to create their own path

## The Trinity Approach

Inspired by the *Deathly Hallows* from Harry Potter â€” three powerful artifacts that together grant mastery â€” **The Trinity Approach** is my framework for deep learning:

![deathly hallows](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f6ac353e-c04b-4743-a123-3b63bf3a4cf6)


**The Three Pillars:**
1. **Books** â€“ Deep, timeless knowledge
2. **Courses / Tutorials / Papers** â€“ Structured, guided learning
3. **Projects** â€“ Real-world application

Individually, each pillar is powerful. Together, they create mastery.
